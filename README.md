# Transfer_Learning_for_CNN_Models_in_MNIST_and_EMNIST

## Project Overview

The **Transfer Learning for CNN Models in MNIST and EMNIST** project explores the use of transfer learning techniques to improve the performance of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on the MNIST and EMNIST datasets. This project demonstrates how pre-trained models can be adapted and fine-tuned to achieve better accuracy on handwritten digit and character recognition tasks.

## Features

- **Transfer Learning**: Utilize pre-trained CNN models and adapt them for MNIST and EMNIST datasets.
- **Model Fine-Tuning**: Fine-tune the pre-trained models to improve classification accuracy.
- **Comparison of Models**: Compare the performance of different models on the MNIST and EMNIST datasets.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language for implementing transfer learning and CNN models.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: Frameworks for building, training, and fine-tuning CNN models.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Environment for running and visualizing the code.

## Datasets

- **MNIST**: A dataset of 70,000 images of handwritten digits (0-9).
- **EMNIST**: An extended version of MNIST, including handwritten letters (A-Z) and digits.
